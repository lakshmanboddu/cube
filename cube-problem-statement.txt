Problem Statement:
JUSPAY

Rotating Cube wireframe: Draw a 3D ​Cube wireframe and rotate it along ​the​ ax​es​ that passes through its center. The rotating object should decelerate at a rate of ‘X’ degrees/sec​^​2 before it comes to a standstill.
The object should respond as follows to the following user inputs

-Swipe/Drag​: Accelerates or decelerates the rotating object as per the difference in velocity between​ rotation and swipe with the friction factor Y.

-Touch/Click​: generates friction that should decelerate the rotation further by a Y (friction factor)

Note:
Use functional programing languages like purescript to solve this problem.
